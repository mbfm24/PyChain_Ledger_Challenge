# PyChain Ledger

You’ll make the following updates to the provided Python file for this
Challenge, which already contains the basic `PyChain` ledger structure that you created throughout the module:

# Step 1: Create a Record Data Class
Create a new data class named `Record`. This class will serve as the blueprint for the financial transaction records that the blocks of the ledger will store.

# Step 2: Modify the Existing Block Data Class to Store Record Data
Change the existing `Block` data class by replacing the generic `data` attribute with a `record` attribute that’s of type `Record`.

# Step 3: Add Relevant User Inputs to the Streamlit Interface
Create additional user input areas in the Streamlit application. These input areas should collect the relevant information for each financial record that you’ll store in the `PyChain` ledger.

# Step 4: Test the PyChain Ledger by Storing Records
Test your complete `PyChain` ledger.
